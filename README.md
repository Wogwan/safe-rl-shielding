To make sure everything works as intended:

Create and activate an environment using virtualenv.

`
virtualenv shielded-learning
'
'
source shielded-learning/bin/activate
`

Clone this repository:
`
git clone https://github.com/safe-rl/safe-rl-shielding.git
`
Install the dependencies:
`
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
`

There is a README file in each environment in the env directory that explains how each example can be run.
